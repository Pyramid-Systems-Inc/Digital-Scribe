- Frontend: React 19 + Vite + TypeScript with Axios for API communication
- Both environments fully configured and operational

*   **Step 1.1.1:** Initialize Git Repository.
    *   Action: Create a new directory `digital-scribe`.
    *   Action: Run `git init` inside the directory.
    *   Action: Create a `.gitignore` file with entries for `node_modules`, `.env`, and `dist` build folders.

*   **Step 1.1.2:** Create Monorepo Structure.
    *   Action: Inside `digital-scribe`, create two directories: `/client` and `/server`.

*   **Step 1.1.3:** Initialize Back-End Server (Node.js + Express + TypeScript).
    *   Action: Navigate to `/server`.
    *   Action: Run `npm init -y`.
    *   Action: Install dependencies: `npm install express cors dotenv`.
    *   Action: Install development dependencies: `npm install -D typescript @types/node @types/express @types/cors ts-node-dev`.
    *   Action: Run `npx tsc --init` to create a `tsconfig.json` file. Configure it with `"outDir": "./dist"` and `"rootDir": "./src"`.
    *   Action: Create a `/server/src` directory with a `server.ts` file inside.
    *   Action: Add `dev` and `start` scripts to `server/package.json`:
        ```json
        "scripts": {
          "build": "tsc",
          "dev": "ts-node-dev --respawn --transpile-only src/server.ts",

### **✅ Task 1.2: Hieroglyph Data Modeling & Sourcing** - COMPLETED
**Description:** Define the data structures for hieroglyphs and the translation mapping. Source initial glyph images.

**✅ IMPLEMENTATION NOTES:**
- 30 hieroglyph definitions implemented in [`glyphs.json`](server/src/data/glyphs.json:1) with complete metadata (glyphId, unicode, phoneticValue, description, category, imageUrl)
- Complete phonetic translation mapping in [`translationMap.json`](server/src/data/translationMap.json:1) covering all English letters plus common digraphs (sh, th, ch, wh)
- All 30 SVG hieroglyph images sourced and stored in [`/client/public/glyphs/`](client/public/glyphs/) directory
- Data structure supports both single-character and multi-character phonetic mappings

*   **Step 1.2.1:** Define the Glyph Data Structure.
    *   Action: In `/server/src`, create a directory named `data`.
    *   Action: Inside `/server/src/data`, create a file `glyphs.json`.
    *   Action: Populate this file with an array of glyph objects. Each object must conform to this schema:
        ```json
        {
          "glyphId": "G1",
          "unicode": "U+13080",
          "phoneticValue": "a",
          "description": "An Egyptian Vulture, representing the 'ah' sound.",
          "category": "Birds"
        }
        ```
    *   Action: Populate with at least 26 glyphs, one for each letter of the English alphabet, plus common digraphs like "sh", "ch", "th".

*   **Step 1.2.2:** Create the Phonetic Translation Map.
    *   Action: In `/server/src/data`, create a file `translationMap.json`.
    *   Action: This file will map lowercase English character(s) to one or more `glyphId`s. This is the core translation logic.
        ```json
        {
          "a": ["G1"],
          "b": ["D58"],
          "sh": ["O34"],
          "th": ["V13", "Q3"] // Example of multiple options
        }
        ```

*   **Step 1.2.3:** Source Glyph Images.
    *   Action: Create a `/client/public/glyphs` directory.
    *   Action: Find or create simple SVG or PNG images for each hieroglyph defined in `glyphs.json`. Name them according to their `glyphId` (e.g., `G1.svg`, `D58.svg`).
    *   Action: In the `glyphs.json` file from Step 1.2.1, add an `imageUrl` field to each object: `"imageUrl": "/glyphs/G1.svg"`.

### **✅ Task 1.3: Backend - Translation API Endpoint** - COMPLETED
**Description:** Build the server-side logic that powers the translation.

**✅ IMPLEMENTATION NOTES:**
- Express server fully configured with CORS support in [`server.ts`](server/src/server.ts:1)
- Complete translation controller implemented in [`translationController.ts`](server/src/controllers/translationController.ts:1) with:
  - Input validation and sanitization
  - Multi-character phonetic matching (e.g., "sh", "th") with priority over single characters
  - Full glyph object lookup and response formatting
  - Proper error handling with appropriate HTTP status codes
- REST API endpoint: **POST** `/api/v1/translate` successfully serving translation requests
- Server running on configurable port (default: 8080) with development hot-reload

*   **Step 1.3.1:** Set up Basic Express Server.
    *   Action: In `/server/src/server.ts`, write the code to initialize an Express app, enable CORS, and listen on a port (e.g., 8080) defined in an environment variable.

*   **Step 1.3.2:** Create the Translation Controller.
    *   Action: Create a file `/server/src/controllers/translationController.ts`.
    *   Action: Inside, create an async function `translateText`. This function will:
        1.  Import `glyphs.json` and `translationMap.json`.
        2.  Accept `text` from the request body.
        3.  Perform input validation: check if `text` is a non-empty string.
        4.  Sanitize the input: convert to lowercase and trim whitespace.
        5.  Implement the translation logic: Iterate through the input string, checking for multi-character matches (like "sh") first, then single-character matches from `translationMap.json`.
        6.  For each match, find the corresponding `glyphId` and look up the full glyph object from `glyphs.json`.
        7.  Collect these full glyph objects into an ordered array.
        8.  Return a `200 OK` response with the JSON array of glyph objects. Handle errors with appropriate status codes (e.g., `400 Bad Request`).

*   **Step 1.3.3:** Define the API Route.
    *   Action: In `server.ts`, create a router for API version 1.
    *   Action: Define the endpoint `POST /api/v1/translate` and link it to the `translateText` controller function.

**🎯 Ready for Phase 2:** With the core functionality proven and operational, we're now positioned to enhance the visual experience with theming, cartouche rendering, and interactive features.
        *   A state for the resulting glyphs: `const [glyphs, setGlyphs] = useState<GlyphType[]>([]);` (Define `GlyphType` based on your JSON structure).
        *   An HTML `<input type="text">` element controlled by `inputText`.
        *   A `<div>` that will serve as the display area.

*   **✅ Step 1.4.2:** Implement Debounced API Calls - COMPLETED
    *   Action: Use the `useEffect` hook to watch for changes in `inputText`.
    *   Action: Inside `useEffect`, implement a debounce mechanism using `setTimeout`.
        *   On each change, clear any existing timeout.
        *   Set a new timeout for ~300ms.
        *   When the timeout executes, make the API call. This prevents a request on every single keystroke.

*   **✅ Step 1.4.3:** Integrate with the Backend API - COMPLETED
    *   Action: Within the debounced `useEffect`, use `axios.post` to send a request to `http://localhost:8080/api/v1/translate` with the body `{ "text": inputText }`.
    *   Action: On a successful response, update the `glyphs` state with the returned data (`setGlyphs(response.data)`).
    *   Action: Implement basic error handling (e.g., `console.error` in a `.catch` block).

*   **✅ Step 1.4.4:** Render the Glyphs - COMPLETED
    *   Action: In the JSX of `HieroglyphComposer`, map over the `glyphs` state array.
    *   Action: For each `glyph` object in the array, render an `<img>` tag.
    *   Action: Set the `src` to `glyph.imageUrl`, the `alt` to `glyph.description`, and provide a unique `key` (e.g., `key={index}-${glyph.glyphId}`).

---

## 🚀 Phase 2: The Visual Experience & User Interaction - READY TO BEGIN

**Objective:** To transform the raw functional MVP into a visually polished and interactive application. The focus is on UI/UX, styling, and creating the signature "cartouche" look.

*   **Step 2.1.2:** Define Theme Constants.
    *   Action: In `tailwind.config.js`, extend the theme to include custom colors (e.g., `papyrusBeige`, `nileBlue`, `goldAccent`) and fonts (e.g., a serif for body text, a display font for headers).

*   **Step 2.1.3:** Implement Global Styles & Layout.
    *   Action: Source a seamless, high-quality papyrus texture image and place it in `/client/public`.
    *   Action: In `client/src/index.css`, apply the papyrus background texture to the `<body>` tag.
    *   Action: Create main layout components: `Header.tsx` (with the app title) and `Footer.tsx` (with credits/links).
    *   Action: Style all base elements using Tailwind utility classes.

### **Task 2.2: Cartouche Rendering Component**
**Description:** Create the iconic oval shape that contains the hieroglyphs.

*   **Step 2.2.1:** Create the `Cartouche` Component.
    *   Action: Create `/client/src/components/Cartouche.tsx`. This component will accept the `glyphs` array as a prop.

*   **Step 2.2.2:** Design the Cartouche Visual.
    *   Action: Create or source an SVG or transparent PNG of the cartouche's oval outline.
    *   Action: In the `Cartouche` component, use this image as a background or an absolutely positioned element. The container must be a relative-positioned `div`.

*   **Step 2.2.3:** Arrange Glyphs within the Cartouche.
    *   Action: Use CSS Grid or Flexbox within the `Cartouche` component to neatly arrange the glyph images passed in as children or props.
    *   Action: Use padding to ensure the glyphs do not touch the edges of the cartouche outline.

### **Task 2.3: Interactive Glyph Tooltips**
**Description:** Add interactivity by showing users information about each glyph on hover.

*   **Step 2.3.1:** Create the `Glyph` Component.
    *   Action: Create `/client/src/components/Glyph.tsx`. It will accept a single `glyph` object as a prop.
    *   Action: This component will be responsible for rendering the glyph's image and handling hover events.

*   **Step 2.3.2:** Create the `Tooltip` Component.
    *   Action: Create `/client/src/components/Tooltip.tsx`. It will accept props like `title`, `description`, `x`, and `y` position.

    *   Action: In the `Glyph` component, use `useState` to track hover state (`isHovered`).
    *   Action: Attach `onMouseEnter` and `onMouseLeave` event handlers to the glyph image to toggle the `isHovered` state.
    *   Action: Conditionally render the `Tooltip` component when `isHovered` is true, passing in the relevant details from the glyph prop.

### **Task 2.4: Responsive Design**
**Description:** Ensure the application is fully functional and looks great on all device sizes.

*   **Step 2.4.1:** Adapt Composer and Cartouche for Mobile.
    *   Action: Use Tailwind's responsive prefixes (`sm:`, `md:`, `lg:`) to adjust the layout.
    *   Action: On small screens, the cartouche might need to stack glyphs vertically or wrap more frequently. The grid layout columns should change (`grid-cols-2 sm:grid-cols-4 md:grid-cols-6`).
    *   Action: Ensure the text input and buttons are large enough for easy tapping on mobile.

*   **Step 2.4.2:** Test and Refine on Different Viewports.
    *   Action: Use browser developer tools to simulate various device sizes (iPhone, iPad, desktop).
    *   Action: Adjust font sizes, margins, and padding as needed to maintain readability and aesthetics across all breakpoints.

    *   Action: Create `handleDownloadPng` and `handleDownloadSvg` functions.
    *   Action: Inside these functions, call the `toPng` or `toSvg` methods from `html-to-image`, passing the `ref.current`.
    *   Action: The library returns a data URL. Create a temporary `<a>` element in memory, set its `href` to the data URL, set its `download` attribute (e.g., `cartouche.png`), programmatically click it, and then remove it from the DOM.

### **Task 3.2: "Learn" Section - Backend & Database**
**Description:** Create the data persistence and API layer for educational content.

*   **Step 3.2.1:** Set Up Database (MongoDB).
    *   Action: Create a free cluster on MongoDB Atlas.
    *   Action: Get the connection string and add it to a `.env` file in the `/server` directory (`MONGO_URI=...`).
    *   Action: Install Mongoose: `npm install mongoose`.

*   **Step 3.2.2:** Define Data Schemas.
    *   Action: Create a `/server/src/models` directory.
    *   Action: Create schema files (e.g., `godModel.ts`, `articleModel.ts`) defining the structure of your content, including fields like `name`, `description`, `imageUrl`, `content`, etc.

    *   Action: Set up the router in `App.tsx` or `main.tsx` to handle routes like `/`, `/learn`, `/learn/glyphs`, `/learn/gods/:id`.

*   **Step 3.3.2:** Build Content Pages.
    *   Action: Create a `/client/src/pages` directory.
    *   Action: Build components for each new page: `HomePage.tsx`, `LearnPage.tsx`, `GlyphGalleryPage.tsx`, `GodProfilePage.tsx`.
    *   Action: On these pages, use `useEffect` and `axios` to fetch data from the new backend endpoints.
    *   Action: Design and style these pages to match the application's theme, focusing on readability and visual appeal.

### **Task 3.4: Social Sharing Integration**
**Description:** Enable users to easily share the application and their creations.

*   **Step 3.4.1:** Add Sharing Buttons.
    *   Action: Add icons/buttons for major social platforms (X/Twitter, Facebook, etc.) near the generated cartouche.

*   **Step 3.4.2:** Implement Simple Share Links.
    *   Action: Use `<a>` tags with pre-formatted URLs to trigger the native share dialog of each platform. Example for Twitter: `https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=I made my name in hieroglyphs with The Digital Scribe!&url=https://your-live-demo-url.com`.

*   **Step 3.4.3 (Advanced):** Implement Pre-filled Cartouche via URL.
    *   Action: Modify the sharing link to include the user's input, e.g., `...com/?name=cleopatra`.
    *   Action: In the `HieroglyphComposer` component, use React Router's `useSearchParams` hook to read the `name` parameter from the URL on page load.
    *   Action: If the parameter exists, set the `inputText` state to its value, which will automatically trigger the translation.

### **Task 4.4: Testing**
**Description:** Write tests to ensure application stability and prevent regressions.

*   **Step 4.4.1:** Unit Tests.
    *   Action: Install Jest and related testing libraries.
    *   Action: Write unit tests for the critical `translateText` function on the server, testing various inputs and edge cases.

*   **Step 4.4.2:** Integration Tests.
    *   Action: Use React Testing Library to write tests for key user flows.
    *   Action: Test the full flow: a user types text into the input, the component displays loading/results, and the correct number of glyph images appear.

### **Task 4.5: Deployment**
**Description:** Push the application to production servers.

*   **Step 4.5.1:** Deploy the Back-End.
    *   Action: Create a new project on a service like **Render** or **Heroku**.
