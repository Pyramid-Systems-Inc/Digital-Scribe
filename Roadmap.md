*   **Step 1.1.3:** Initialize Back-End Server (Node.js + Express + TypeScript).
    *   Action: Navigate to `/server`.
    *   Action: Run `npm init -y`.
    *   Action: Install dependencies: `npm install express cors dotenv`.
    *   Action: Install development dependencies: `npm install -D typescript @types/node @types/express @types/cors ts-node-dev`.
    *   Action: Run `npx tsc --init` to create a `tsconfig.json` file. Configure it with `"outDir": "./dist"` and `"rootDir": "./src"`.
    *   Action: Create a `/server/src` directory with a `server.ts` file inside.
    *   Action: Add `dev` and `start` scripts to `server/package.json`:
        ```json
        "scripts": {
          "build": "tsc",
          "dev": "ts-node-dev --respawn --transpile-only src/server.ts",

### **‚úÖ Task 1.2: Hieroglyph Data Modeling & Sourcing** - COMPLETED
**Description:** Define the data structures for hieroglyphs and the translation mapping. Source initial glyph images.

**‚úÖ IMPLEMENTATION NOTES:**
- 30 hieroglyph definitions implemented in [`glyphs.json`](server/src/data/glyphs.json:1) with complete metadata (glyphId, unicode, phoneticValue, description, category, imageUrl)
- Complete phonetic translation mapping in [`translationMap.json`](server/src/data/translationMap.json:1) covering all English letters plus common digraphs (sh, th, ch, wh)
- All 30 SVG hieroglyph images sourced and stored in [`/client/public/glyphs/`](client/public/glyphs/) directory
- Data structure supports both single-character and multi-character phonetic mappings

*   **Step 1.2.1:** Define the Glyph Data Structure.
    *   Action: In `/server/src`, create a directory named `data`.
    *   Action: Inside `/server/src/data`, create a file `glyphs.json`.
    *   Action: Populate this file with an array of glyph objects. Each object must conform to this schema:
        ```json
        {
          "glyphId": "G1",
          "unicode": "U+13080",
          "phoneticValue": "a",
          "description": "An Egyptian Vulture, representing the 'ah' sound.",
          "category": "Birds"
        }
        ```
    *   Action: Populate with at least 26 glyphs, one for each letter of the English alphabet, plus common digraphs like "sh", "ch", "th".

*   **Step 1.2.2:** Create the Phonetic Translation Map.
    *   Action: In `/server/src/data`, create a file `translationMap.json`.
    *   Action: This file will map lowercase English character(s) to one or more `glyphId`s. This is the core translation logic.
        ```json
        {
          "a": ["G1"],
          "b": ["D58"],
          "sh": ["O34"],
          "th": ["V13", "Q3"] // Example of multiple options
        }
        ```

*   **Step 1.2.3:** Source Glyph Images.
    *   Action: Create a `/client/public/glyphs` directory.
    *   Action: Find or create simple SVG or PNG images for each hieroglyph defined in `glyphs.json`. Name them according to their `glyphId` (e.g., `G1.svg`, `D58.svg`).
    *   Action: In the `glyphs.json` file from Step 1.2.1, add an `imageUrl` field to each object: `"imageUrl": "/glyphs/G1.svg"`.

### **‚úÖ Task 1.3: Backend - Translation API Endpoint** - COMPLETED
**Description:** Build the server-side logic that powers the translation.

**‚úÖ IMPLEMENTATION NOTES:**
- Express server fully configured with CORS support in [`server.ts`](server/src/server.ts:1)
- Complete translation controller implemented in [`translationController.ts`](server/src/controllers/translationController.ts:1) with:
  - Input validation and sanitization
  - Multi-character phonetic matching (e.g., "sh", "th") with priority over single characters
  - Full glyph object lookup and response formatting
  - Proper error handling with appropriate HTTP status codes
- REST API endpoint: **POST** `/api/v1/translate` successfully serving translation requests
- Server running on configurable port (default: 8080) with development hot-reload

*   **Step 1.3.1:** Set up Basic Express Server.
    *   Action: In `/server/src/server.ts`, write the code to initialize an Express app, enable CORS, and listen on a port (e.g., 8080) defined in an environment variable.

*   **Step 1.3.2:** Create the Translation Controller.
    *   Action: Create a file `/server/src/controllers/translationController.ts`.
    *   Action: Inside, create an async function `translateText`. This function will:
        1.  Import `glyphs.json` and `translationMap.json`.
        2.  Accept `text` from the request body.
        3.  Perform input validation: check if `text` is a non-empty string.
        4.  Sanitize the input: convert to lowercase and trim whitespace.
        5.  Implement the translation logic: Iterate through the input string, checking for multi-character matches (like "sh") first, then single-character matches from `translationMap.json`.
        6.  For each match, find the corresponding `glyphId` and look up the full glyph object from `glyphs.json`.
        7.  Collect these full glyph objects into an ordered array.
        8.  Return a `200 OK` response with the JSON array of glyph objects. Handle errors with appropriate status codes (e.g., `400 Bad Request`).

*   **Step 1.3.3:** Define the API Route.
    *   Action: In `server.ts`, create a router for API version 1.
    *   Action: Define the endpoint `POST /api/v1/translate` and link it to the `translateText` controller function.

**üéØ Ready for Phase 2:** With the core functionality proven and operational, we're now positioned to enhance the visual experience with theming, cartouche rendering, and interactive features.
        *   A state for the resulting glyphs: `const [glyphs, setGlyphs] = useState<GlyphType[]>([]);` (Define `GlyphType` based on your JSON structure).
        *   An HTML `<input type="text">` element controlled by `inputText`.
        *   A `<div>` that will serve as the display area.

*   **‚úÖ Step 1.4.2:** Implement Debounced API Calls - COMPLETED
    *   Action: Use the `useEffect` hook to watch for changes in `inputText`.
    *   Action: Inside `useEffect`, implement a debounce mechanism using `setTimeout`.
        *   On each change, clear any existing timeout.
        *   Set a new timeout for ~300ms.
        *   When the timeout executes, make the API call. This prevents a request on every single keystroke.

*   **‚úÖ Step 1.4.3:** Integrate with the Backend API - COMPLETED
    *   Action: Within the debounced `useEffect`, use `axios.post` to send a request to `http://localhost:8080/api/v1/translate` with the body `{ "text": inputText }`.
    *   Action: On a successful response, update the `glyphs` state with the returned data (`setGlyphs(response.data)`).
    *   Action: Implement basic error handling (e.g., `console.error` in a `.catch` block).

*   **‚úÖ Step 1.4.4:** Render the Glyphs - COMPLETED
    *   Action: In the JSX of `HieroglyphComposer`, map over the `glyphs` state array.
    *   Action: For each `glyph` object in the array, render an `<img>` tag.
    *   Action: Set the `src` to `glyph.imageUrl`, the `alt` to `glyph.description`, and provide a unique `key` (e.g., `key={index}-${glyph.glyphId}`).

**Description:** Make the application usable by everyone and discoverable by search engines.

*   **Step 4.3.1:** Accessibility Audit.
    *   Action: Ensure all interactive elements are keyboard navigable. Check the tab order.
    *   Action: Add appropriate ARIA attributes (`aria-label`, `aria-hidden`) where needed, especially for icon-only buttons and tooltips.
    *   Action: Use a tool like the Lighthouse or Axe browser extension to audit the site and fix contrast and other accessibility issues.

*   **Step 4.3.2:** SEO & Metadata.
    *   Action: In `/client`, install `react-helmet-async`.
    *   Action: In `App.tsx`, wrap your application with `<HelmetProvider>`.
    *   Action: In each page component, use the `<Helmet>` component to set unique `<title>`, `<meta name="description">`, and Open Graph tags (`og:title`, `og:image`, etc.) to ensure rich previews when sharing links.

### **Task 4.4: Testing**
**Description:** Write tests to ensure application stability and prevent regressions.

*   **Step 4.4.1:** Unit Tests.
    *   Action: Install Jest and related testing libraries.
    *   Action: Write unit tests for the critical `translateText` function on the server, testing various inputs and edge cases.

*   **Step 4.4.2:** Integration Tests.
    *   Action: Use React Testing Library to write tests for key user flows.
    *   Action: Test the full flow: a user types text into the input, the component displays loading/results, and the correct number of glyph images appear.

### **Task 4.5: Deployment**
**Description:** Push the application to production servers.

*   **Step 4.5.1:** Deploy the Back-End.
    *   Action: Create a new project on a service like **Render** or **Heroku**.
    *   Action: Connect it to your GitHub repository (the `/server` directory).
    *   Action: Set the build command to `npm install && npm run build` and the start command to `npm start`.
    *   Action: Configure the `MONGO_URI` and `PORT` environment variables in the platform's dashboard.

*   **Step 4.5.2:** Deploy the Front-End.
    *   Action: Create a new project on **Vercel**.
    *   Action: Connect it to your GitHub repository (the `/client` directory). Vercel will auto-detect the Vite configuration.
    *   Action: Add an environment variable `VITE_API_BASE_URL` and set its value to the live URL of your deployed back-end server.
    *   Action: Update the `axios` base URL in your client code to use this environment variable.

*   **Step 4.5.3:** Final Launch.
    *   Action: Register a custom domain name.
    *   Action: Configure the DNS settings on Vercel to use the custom domain.
    *   Action: Test the entire live application from end to end.
    *   **Action: Launch and share!**
